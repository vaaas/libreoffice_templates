# LibreOffice Templates

This repository holds templates for LibreOffice documents. Place them in your `~/Templates` directory. You might want to have the Linux Libertine fonts installed.

## Writing Template

Landscape template with many columns that fits well in wide screens (16:9 ratio). Fits way more text per page overall compared to portrait pages, but also keeps the lines relatively short so that your eyes don't get lost tracking them. Uses sane styles for body text.
